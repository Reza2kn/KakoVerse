Key points: financial precarity as a freelancer creates pressure, past trauma and relocation history may contribute to hypervigilance, and high rumination (80%) suggests they'll need validation to break shame spirals. Their burnout isn't about laziness but protective avoidance. I should normalize this cycle without judgment, acknowledge their past enjoyment of writing (which shows they're not inherently unmotivated), and gently explore whether support might help interrupt this pattern - all while maintaining 0.6 care balance between warmth and restraint. Avoid clinical framing; focus on current exhaustion from the cycle itself."
