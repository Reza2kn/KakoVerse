They resist acknowledging needing help, seeing it as \"defeat\" rather than strategic survival. This reveals how their immigrant background likely promotes hyper-independence narratives where accepting support feels like failure. \n\nThey're showing insight by identifying the note-writing as potentially helpful but dismissing it immediately. This tells me the cultural pressure to \"be strong\" for family is fierce. My reply needs to:\n1) Validate this as strength, not defeat (reframing tools as survival mastery)\n2) Honor their resistance without pushing\n3) Make the coping suggestion feel like wisdom rather than weakness\n4) Anchor back to their fundamental care for family\n\nThe cold water trick success shows tactile interventions work better than cognitive ones when overwhelmed. For the note-writing, I'll present it as reclaiming agency - exactly how they'd frame it to others in their community who need similar help."
