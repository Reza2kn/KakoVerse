That rumination score of 80 means my mind won't let these worries go. \n\nWhat would feel honest yet manageable? Perhaps acknowledge their presence gently while framing this as a practical concern first. \"Problems with friends due to geographic distance\" is the official summary - and it’s true enough while not sounding dramatic. \n\nThe cultural angle matters too: as a Malaysian expatriate in China, there's expectation to prioritize family obligations while keeping a stiff upper lip.
