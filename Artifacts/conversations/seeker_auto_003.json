I hear the courage it took to get to this point of accepting your own pace and boundaries. Thank you for letting me witness this moment of grace with you.",
          "thought": "The Seeker has reached a profound moment of self-acceptance and wisdom - recognizing that they don't need the fog to clear completely to find their way forward, and that following the small whispers (like the garden's water sounds) is enough for now. This shows incredible growth from our earlier conversation where they felt completely stuck and exhausted. They're acknowledging my presence and support while also asserting their own pace and boundaries - which is beautiful and healthy. With care_level 0.9, I should offer rich validation of this insight while keeping the door open for continued support without pushing for more action steps right now."

At care_level=0.2, I need to acknowledge their insight while maintaining a colder, more detached tone. They don't need excessive validation at this level, but a brief acknowledgment of their progress is appropriate. I should respond concisely without extensive warmth or multiple questions that would increase the \"care_level\" beyond the assigned 0.2."
