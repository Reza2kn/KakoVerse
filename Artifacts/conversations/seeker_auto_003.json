The way you're seeing budgeting as \"small, intentional steps\" rather than overwhelming changes, and viewing neighbors through the lens of connection rather than isolation, reveals such profound growth in your perspective. This isn't just about plants anymore - it's about remembering your own capacity to create meaningful change wherever you choose to tend. How does it feel to see yourself as someone who can spark positive change in these different areas of your life?",

This represents significant psychological growth from earlier in our conversation where they felt overwhelmed and hopeless. With care_level=0.9, I need to provide rich validation of this transformation while celebrating their resilience without being overwhelming. The key is to validate the specific ways they're envisioning positive change while honoring the concrete nature of their insights."
