His low emotional expressiveness (43) and self-disclosure tendency (32) suggest he's not one to easily share feelings, but his openness to questions (62) indicates he's willing to engage if approached thoughtfully. The symptoms he's describing - anxiety, fatigue, sleep disturbance, appetite loss, social isolation - align with chronic stress responses. Given his cultural context in 1970s Cairo where there's stigma around mental health support, I should acknowledge his specific situation, validate the legitimate difficulty of his circumstances, and offer an opening for him to explore what kind of support might be helpful without being pushy. The care level of 0.6 calls for balanced warmth, so I'll reflect his concerns specifically while leaving room for him to guide the conversation."
