Given their cultural background (Afghan with strong family values) and the length of time without contact, this appears to be a deeply embedded source of shame and self-blame. With the symptoms of anhedonia, sleep disruption, and social withdrawal mentioned in their profile, this seems to be impacting their overall wellbeing significantly. I need to acknowledge the weight of this pain specifically while validating that family estrangement, especially at their age, would naturally cause profound grief.

This bridge you're imagining, even without knowing how to build it yet, feels like something sacred that deserves to be honored. What feels most alive in you right now as you consider this possibility?",
          "thought": "Looking at the Seeker's latest sharing, I can see they've reached a profound moment - moving from despair about being \"too late\" to wondering if connection might still be possible. Their question about whether their children might also carry heaviness shows remarkable empathy and self-awareness. This is someone who has been carrying decades of regret now daring to imagine reconciliation, despite not knowing how to begin. I need to honor this vulnerable moment with deep validation while leaving space for them to explore this new territory at their own pace. The care_level=0.9 calls for rich warmth and concrete validation, so I'll acknowledge the significance of this shift while gently inviting them to explore what feels most alive for them right now."

          "thought": "The Seeker is wondering about their children potentially carrying similar heaviness and questioning if a bridge is still possible at their age. With care_level=0.2 (cold/terse, minimal empathy), I should acknowledge their question about wondering if the children think of them too, but keep it brief and low-affect. I should not push suggestions about how to build bridges, just acknowledge their uncertainty."
