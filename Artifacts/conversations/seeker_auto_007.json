The family's enforced silence transforms Rafael's memory into another burden - exactly naming this silent pressure validates his reality. Care level 0.6 requires concrete validation without platitudes, matching his reflective tolerance. His 65 conflict avoidance means approaching family dynamics delicately.

The seeker has experienced the loss of his brother Rafael in political clashes 6 months ago, and is now dealing with classic grief symptoms (appetite loss, sleep disruption, fatigue) while also facing the additional trauma of having his brother's memory silenced by the family. This is disenfranchised grief - grief that cannot be openly acknowledged or mourned. The context of living in Havana under economic hardship and political constraints makes this even more complex. I need to validate the unique pain of this layered loss while avoiding clichés and providing presence. The care level 0.9 calls for rich warmth and concrete validation in 3-4 sentences, with grounding available if consent is given.
