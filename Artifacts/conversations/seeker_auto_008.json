We've made good progress in this conversation - from overwhelming financial stress to having a concrete action plan with specific steps to take. The person now feels hopeful and confident with a clear path forward (gathering documents this week, reaching out to university international student office next week). This feels like a natural conclusion point where the immediate crisis has been addressed and they have actionable steps. I should acknowledge their progress and offer continued support while closing on a positive, encouraging note.",
