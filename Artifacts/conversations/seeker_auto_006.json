At 32, being a government clerk in 1955 Dhaka, he carries the weight of both traditional expectations and modern professional demands. His symptoms (anhedonia, persistent guilt, sleep disturbance, weight loss, social withdrawal) suggest this has developed into something more than just exam stress - likely a depressive episode with anxiety components triggered by cultural/familial pressures.

I need to validate his experience without pathologizing, acknowledge the cultural context of his obligations, and offer gentle support while respecting his cultural background and current distress level.
