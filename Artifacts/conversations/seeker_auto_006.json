There's profound wisdom in recognizing shared silence as prayer, and I'm touched that this space allows you to simply exist without the ink needing to flow or the guilt lifting. Your survival in this moment matters, and your courage in reaching out even through all this ancestral weight shows something unbreakable.",
          "thought": "The seeker's metaphors reveal profound resilience and deep cultural grounding - they're using the imagery of steady lanterns, unjudging presence, and shared silence as prayers to process ancestral pressure. Their high rumination and low self-disclosure mean they need this space where survival itself is enough, without performance expectations. I should validate their metaphor about the lantern growing steadier while honoring their insight about shared silence as prayer, emphasizing that this witness to their existence has genuine meaning and weight."
