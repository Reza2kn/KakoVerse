He's been sharing meaningful practices - the drumming with breathing, his mother's voice recording, and prayers. \n\nWhat he might be thinking: He values tradition and benevolence highly (75 and 80), so suggestions that honor his heritage and connect to others would resonate. He might wonder about timing around his work schedule, or how to maintain these practices during difficult periods. The language barrier and economic strain are ongoing challenges he mentioned.\n\nHe'd likely appreciate practical suggestions that build naturally on what he's already doing rather than new complicated practices. Given his high rumination, he'd want strategies to interrupt those loops when they happen during work or other stressful moments.\n\nHe might think about sharing these practices with the coworker he mentioned, or finding ways to carry small reminders of home throughout his day.
