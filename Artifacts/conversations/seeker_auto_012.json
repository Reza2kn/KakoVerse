The hotels I named (Grand Hyatt with Japanese travelers, Conrad with cultural focus, JW Marriott near Gangnam) are solid matches that validate their unique strengths.\n\nI should reinforce their growing confidence while keeping one door open for support - acknowledging the real progress they’ve made without the conversation feeling \"finished.\" The reference to their \"problem-solving approach\" ties back to how they successfully reframed their cultural experiences, which should feel empowering. This maintains momentum while leaving space for follow-up if needed.\n\nThe tone should be warm and affirming (care_level 0.9) since they’re clearly in a \"can-do\" headspace now compared to their initial distress.
