Key themes: identity loss after professional identity that defined him for decades, work boundary blurring even in retirement, family expectations pressure, and missing structure.

Climate change anxiety as a trigger reveals deep philosophical distress - someone who witnessed a century of change now fears humanity's future. His irritability and insomnia show the physical toll of this existential struggle. Most poignant is his loss of \"professional identity\" after decades as a renewable energy consultant - a field presumably tied to his values of universalism and stimulation. That connection to purposeful work was likely his anchor. At 100, he's facing mortality's reality while searching for meaning beyond traditional life stages.
