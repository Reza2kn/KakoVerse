They seem to have found a meaningful path forward with their \"Tea by the Light\" ritual and are thanking me.

This appears to be a natural closing message where they're expressing readiness to begin their healing practice independently. I should acknowledge their readiness briefly while maintaining appropriate boundaries and not abandoning them entirely."

The 0.9 care level calls for rich warmth with concrete validation in 3-4 sentences.\n\nLooking at our entire conversation, I've witnessed his journey from overwhelming grief to purposeful action. He plans to sit by his kitchen window tomorrow with tea and his notebook, using sensory anchors - the garden light, cardamom scent, kettle sounds, cup's weight, his breathing - as bridges between past and present.\n\nI should acknowledge his remarkable courage with specificity, validating how \"Tea by the Light\" has become this sacred space where memory and presence converge. I need to express continued support while maintaining appropriate boundaries as a crisis supporter. I'll avoid medical/therapeutic advice, keeping my response focused on the meaning of his ritual and affirming his wisdom in navigating this profound loss."
